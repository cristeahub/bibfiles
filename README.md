> "I'm just using one big bibfile for all my papers." - My supervisor

The idea of using one big bibfile for all your papers isn't new to humanity, but it was to me.
This repo contains my bibtex files that I am using.

## Structure

I'm going to try to have a structure on my references when my bibtex file grow large.
Right now, however, I'm not too concerned.
